        At Nobisoft, I specialize in leveraging Linux and cloud platforms to
        develop reliable backend infrastructures, while also sharing my
        expertise as a Software Engineering Coach at UniGap, helping the next
        generation of engineers bridge the gap between theory and real-world
        applications.
        <br className="sm:block hidden" />
        My academic journey in Data Science at Liverpool John Moores University
        and IIIT Bangalore has honed my ability to solve complex data challenges
        strategically. Certified as an IBM Data Warehouse Engineer, I excel in
        building efficient ETL pipelines, optimizing databases with MySQL,
        Oracle, and MongoDB, and implementing cloud-native solutions that drive
        business growth.
        <br className="sm:block hidden" />
        Beyond the technical, I thrive on solving problems, mentoring others,
        and exploring how data can empower organizations to innovate. I’m driven
        by a vision to contribute to impactful projects and make technology
        accessible, efficient, and transformative.
